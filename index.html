        <h3>OBJECTIVE</h3>
        <p>
            <ul>
                <li>Cristiano Ronaldo dos Santos Aveiro ( born 5 February 1985) is a Portuguese professional footballer who plays as a forward for Serie A club Juventus and captains the Portugal national team. Often considered the best player in the world
                    and widely regarded as one of the greatest players of all time, Ronaldo has won five Ballon d'Or awards and four European Golden Shoes, both of which are records for a European player. He has won 30 major trophies in his career, including
                    seven league titles, five UEFA Champions Leagues, one UEFA European Championship, and one UEFA Nations League title. Ronaldo holds the records for the most goals (134) and assists (41) in the history of the UEFA Champions League. He
                    is one of the few recorded players to have made over 1,000 professional career appearances and has scored over 750 senior career goals for club and country. He is also the second player to score 100 international goals, and the first
                    European to achieve the feat. </li>

        <h3>Skills & Abilities</h3>
        <h4> Style of play</h4>
        <p></p><strong>A versatile attacker, Ronaldo is capable of playing on either wing as well as through the centre of the pitch, and while ostensibly right-footed, is very strong with both feet. He ranks among the world's fastest footballers, both with and without the ball. Tactically, Ronaldo has undergone several evolutions throughout his career. While at Sporting and during his first season at Manchester United, he was typically deployed as a traditional winger on the right side of midfield, where he regularly looked to deliver crosses into the penalty area. In this position, he was able to use his pace and acceleration, agility, and technical skills to take on opponents in one-on-one situations. Ronaldo became noted for his dribbling and flair, often displaying an array of tricks and feints such as the step overs and so-called 'chops' that became his trademark he has also been known to use the flip–flap.</strong></p>
